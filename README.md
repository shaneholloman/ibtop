cd ibtop

# Build and install
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/ibtop /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

```bash
# Monitor all InfiniBand adapters
ibtop

# Start with throughput shown in bits/sec
ibtop --bits
```

### Controls

- `q` or `ESC` - Quit
- `j` / `k` or arrow keys - Navigate ports
- `Enter` - Toggle detail view
- `b` - Toggle bits/sec vs bytes/sec throughput
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` - Switch detail tabs (when detail view is open)
- `r` - Force refresh

## Requirements

- Linux system with InfiniBand sysfs (`/sys/class/infiniband/`)
- Terminal with color support
- Rust 1.70+ (for building from source)

## Compatibility

- **Mellanox mlx5** - Fully tested, counters use 32-bit word units
- **Mellanox mlx4** - Expected to work (same counter format)
- **Intel/Cornelis** - May require adjustments for hw_counters path
- **Other IB adapters** - Should work if they follow standard sysfs layout
